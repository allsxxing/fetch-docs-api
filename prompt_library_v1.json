      "id": "COLLAB_001_THE_FITTING",
      "prompt": "Cinematic 4k medium shot. Interior of a vault-lit jewelry boutique. Trillipino Jollibee leans back in a throne-like velvet chair as a realistic Johnny Dang fits a massive yellow-diamond Chickenjoy pendant. The camera dollies in tight on Jollibee's face as he flashes his grill; blinding prismatic lens flares explode from the diamonds. The gold chains have heavy, realistic mass, resting deeply on the red silk blazer lapels. High-contrast lighting."

      "id": "COLLAB_002_JEEPNEY_SLAB",
      "prompt": "Low-angle wide cinematic tracking shot. A candy-red Jeepney Slab 'slow-crawls' down a neon-lit Houston street. The chrome 84s elbows spin aggressively, catching purple streetlamp reflections. Jollibee stands on the rear step, one foam hand gripping the chrome rail, the other tossing 'Jolly-Bucks' that flutter in the slipstream. The Jeepney hits a hydraulic 'bounce'—the entire vehicle frame reacts with heavy, rhythmic momentum. High-energy urban vibe."

    {
      "id": "COLLAB_003_CHICKENJOY_RAIN",
      "prompt": "Extreme slow-motion at 120fps. Jollibee and Johnny Dang stand back-to-back in a dark void lit by purple and gold spotlights. A torrential rain of hyper-realistic crispy Chickenjoy and loose VVS diamonds falls through the air. Jollibee snaps from a 'shocked' cheek-hold into a crisp 'Westside' hand sign. Diamonds bounce off the mascot's shoulders with rigid physics and sharp clinking sounds. Particles catch the light in a chaotic, glittering display."

    {
      "id": "COLLAB_004_SWERVE_N_SERVE",
      "prompt": "Fast-paced GoPro-style 'Slab-cam' shot. A Jeepney Slab swerves violently into a Jollibee drive-thru, hydraulics dipping low as it turns. The chrome elbows narrowly graze the curb with high-speed motion blur. Trillipino Jollibee leans out of the driver's side, iced-out grill shimmering, and thrusts a bucket of chicken toward the lens. The camera shakes slightly on impact to emphasize the heavy bass and Houston street energy."
